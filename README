This is your new Play 2.1 application
=====================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.


I'm attempting to get an introduction to the Play framework, and Scala programming language.

This code is from the Tutorial http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.x/ScalaTodoList

http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.x/ScalaHome


Goals:

1) complete the Tutorial, and have a working Play/Scala app for a Todo List

2) build tests with the Play framework
    verify small unit tests can be built
    verify medium tests of two components and/or a mock object can be built
    verify large tests cam be built running against a headless browser, and a interactive browser
    verify large tests can be run against Selenium grid, and Internet Explorer

Test frameworks to try:
    Play framework
    Specs2
    FluentLenium
    ScalaTest 1.6.1
